Description: A systematic biology tool was developed to repurpose drugs via a subpathway crosstalk network. The operation modes include 1) calculating centrality scores of SPs in the context of gene expression data to reflect the influence of SP crosstalk, 2) evaluating drug-disease reverse association based on disease- and drug-induced SPs weighted by the SP crosstalk, 3) identifying cancer candidate drugs through perturbation analysis. There are also several functions used to visualize the results.
