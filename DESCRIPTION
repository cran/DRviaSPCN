Description: A systematic biology tool was developed to repurpose drugs via a subpathway crosstalk network. The operation modes include 1) evaluating the eigenvector centrality (centrality score) of subpathways and identifying dysregulated subpathways in the subpathway-subpathway network, 2) evaluating the activity of subpathways by GSEA and weighting them with corresponding centrality score, 3) identifying optimal drugs for specific disease through constructing disease-drug reverse association based on the weighted activity of subpathways. There are also several functions used to visualize the results.
